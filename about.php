						<p>Dr. Carter's longtime love of animals encouraged him to pursue a degree in biology from UNLV. He went on to further study at Los Angeles College of Chiropractic where he earned the degree of Chiropractic Physician. With his ongoing interest in animal wellness, Dr. Carter received post graduate training in Animal Chiropractic at Parker Chiropractic College in Texas. He is now a dedicated member of the American Veterinary Chiropractic Association working in conjunction with veterinarians throughout Nevada to provide complete animal care. When asked why Dr. Carter chooses to dedicate his practice to animals he says, "Because animals don't lie and they are able to respond quickly and successfully to treatment."</p>
